<h1>Heart Disease Prediction - Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)</h1>
<h2>Overview</h2>
This project aims to explore, analyze, and visualize data related to heart disease prediction. The primary objective is to gain insights into the data and identify key factors that might contribute to heart disease. The analysis includes data cleaning, feature analysis, visualization, and correlation studies to understand the relationship between various attributes and the target variable (presence of heart disease).
<h2>Dataset</h2>
The dataset has been uploaded. It consists of several medical features and a target variable indicating the presence of heart disease.
<h2>Features</h2>
<ul>
    <li>Age: Age of the patient</li>
    <li>Sex: Gender of the patient (1 = male, 0 = female)</li>
    <li>ChestPainType: Type of chest pain experienced (4 values)</li>
    <li>RestingBP: Resting blood pressure</li>
    <li>Cholesterol: Serum cholesterol level</li>
    <li>FastingBS: Fasting blood sugar > 120 mg/dl (1 = true, 0 = false)</li>
    <li>RestingECG: Resting electrocardiographic results (3 values)</li>
    <li>MaxHR: Maximum heart rate achieved</li>
    <li>ExerciseAngina: Exercise-induced angina (1 = yes, 0 = no)</li>
    <li>Oldpeak: ST depression induced by exercise relative to rest</li>
    <li>ST_Slope: Slope of the peak exercise ST segment</li>
    <li>Target: Diagnosis of heart disease (1 = presence, 0 = absence)</li>
</ul>
<h2>Results</h2>
The analysis reveals several important factors that correlate with heart disease, including age, sex, cholesterol levels, chest pain type, and maximum heart rate. The visualizations help in understanding the distribution and relationships among these variables, providing a foundation for building predictive models in the future.
<h2>Dependencies</h2>
To run the analysis, you'll need the following Python libraries:
<code>pandas
numpy
matplotlib
seaborn
scikit-learn
jupyter
</code>
<h2>Installation</h2>
